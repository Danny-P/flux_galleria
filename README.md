TYPO3 extension Galleria - includes Galleria image and video gallery based on flux and fluidcontent
=================================================================================================

## What is it?

A fully featured image and video gallery oriented Fluid Content Elements written for 'EXT:fluidcontent' and EXT: 'flux'. The JavaScript framework is build by the team of http://galleria.io/

## What does it do?

Provides the template files and TypoScript setup necessary to use the gallery element. Galleria is a pure JavaScript image gallery solution for the web and mobile devices.

## How does it do it?

By leveraging the integration logic provided by 'EXT:fluidcontent' - enabling use of specially constructed Fluid templates as
content elements, much like the Flexible Content Elements concept from TemplaVoila.

## How is it installed?

Download, install the extension and include the static TypoScript configuration.

## How is it used?

After installation and inclusion of the static TypoScript, the included content elements will be available as new content element
inside of 'Fluid Content Element' tab.

Add a new Content element and adjust the look and feel with the large set of configuration options.

## Check out all options

All docs for customization of the gallery can be found at http://galleria.io/docs/ - the awesome gallery framework, which makes this whole project possible.
